# bytebite

ByteBite is an application that aims to make it quick and easy to find nutritional information about different foods. We’ve noticed that most other applications don’t provide all the necessary information for people that have food restrictions or are doing specific diets, so we want to make a website that has all the information in the same place.

Our application has multiple different features like a food view, meal builder, food tracker and other things. 

Nutritional Calculator:
- Adding different foods into a list and finding the totals for different nutritional information like calories and sodium content.

Meal Builder:
- Takes different foods and adds them to a list for a specific meal
- You can make multiple meals
- Possible favorite meal feature
- Ability to delete a meal

Food lookup:
- Search function that will have filters to make finding types of foods easier

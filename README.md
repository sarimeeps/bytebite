# bytebite

ByteBite is an application that aims to make it quick and easy to find nutritional information about different foods. We’ve noticed that most other applications don’t provide all the necessary information for people that have food restrictions or are doing specific diets, so we want to make a website that has all the information in the same place.

Our application has multiple different features like a food view, meal builder, food tracker and other things. Below are the different functionalities that we aim to implement:

Food Lookup:
- The Food Lookup feature will allow the user to search for specific food items and also filter the search based on different criteria. The user will also be able to apply multiple filters at once in order to get a more precise search. The goal is to make finding specific food items as easy as possible for the user.

Nutritional Calculator:
- This feature will allow users to add different food items to a list and once the list is updated various nutritional information will be displayed for all the foods in the list.
- Examples would include total calorie count of the list or total sugar content of the list.

Meal Builder:
- Our meal builder will allow users to make multiple meals that have different ingredients in each. Once a user has a food selected they will then be able to add it to a specific meal of their choice.
- The meal builder will also allow users to create new meals and remove ones they don’t want to have anymore. The user will be able to favorite any of the meals they have created.
